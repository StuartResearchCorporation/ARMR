m 23 Project Charter <br> Polymorphic ARM Assembly Encoder#

## Team Members:
Abdalla Almazmi, Samuel Fellers, Jacob Stuart, Rishabh Saxena, Chris Von Hoene
## Problem Statement:
There are currently encoders that work well with metasploit for many languages and architectures. But, there are no encoders currently that work with ARM assembly. Our encoder will follow the Shikata Ga Nai enocder in being a polymorphic xor additive feedback solution.
## Project Objectives:
1. Deterministically encode invalid bits
2. Deterministically encode an entire binary with a stub
3. If time permits: polymorphically encode an entire binary
## Stakeholders:
**Users:** Users of this utility will include security researchers and penetration testers
**Project Owner:** Abdalla Almazmi, Samuel Fellers, Jacob Stuart, Rishabh Saxena, Chris Von Hoene, Senior Software Engineer at Northrop Grumman Xetron
**Developers:** Abdalla Almazmi, Samuel Fellers, Jacob Stuart, Rishabh Saxena, Chris Von Hoene
**Project Manager:** Jacob Stuart
## Deliverables:
1. Integration with the metasploit framework
2. Illegal character encoding
3. Binary signature obfuscation
